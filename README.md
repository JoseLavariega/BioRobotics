This project consists on understanding and evaluating a robotic 2DOF + ankle leg to be optimized for maximum horizontal distance jumping. 
The leg is inspired out of how kangaroos can jump for large distances from rest, and we aim to understand how the incidence angle affects this with the leg mentioned above. 

Control will be done through optimal control to follow a set of Bezier points for an endfoot starting from x=0 and ending at some high horizontal distance. Optimal control uses joint space control.
